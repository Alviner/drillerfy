To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the 'Fork' button on the repository page to create your own copy of the repository.

2. **Create a Branch**: Create a branch in your fork for your changes. It's best to name the branch something descriptive.

3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, adhering to the coding standards and guidelines of the project.

4. **Write Tests**: Ensure that your changes are covered by tests. We strive to maintain a high level of code quality and test coverage.

### Code Review Process

Maintainers will review your pull request. We aim for a prompt review, but response times can vary based on availability. During the review process, we may:

- Provide feedback and request changes if necessary.
- Merge your pull request once it is approved and all criteria are met.

### Coding Standards
